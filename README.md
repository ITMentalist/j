# j
Java Toolbox for IBM i

## What is j?
**J** is a small framework that wraps the JTOpen (JT400) library, to make its usage more user-friendly.
I initially developed it to avoid boring manual tasks, but soon I realised it could grow further and show its true potential.
**J** allows control over libraries, objects (which includes database files, device files, printer files), members, users, jobs and the machine itself.
It also provides access to certain IBM API.
